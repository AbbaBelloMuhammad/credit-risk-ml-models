# Credit Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques

This project is a Master's dissertation focused on comparing six machine learning models:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Logistic Regression
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbours

## Dataset
Data was obtained from Gombe Microfinance Bank Ltd (2020â€“2021). Due to confidentiality, the dataset is not publicly shared.

## R Scripts
All R scripts used for modelling are available under `R_Codes/`.
